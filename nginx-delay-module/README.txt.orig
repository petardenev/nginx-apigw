Delay module for nginx.

This module allows to delay requests for a given time.

Configuration directives:

    delay <time>

        Context: http, server, location
        Default: 0

        Delay requests for a given time.

Usage:

    location = /slow {
        delay 10s;
        ...
    }

Note that internal redirects (e.g. directory index ones) will trigger another
delay.

To compile nginx with delay module, use "--add-module <path>" option
to nginx configure.

Development of this module was sponsored by Openstat (http://www.openstat.com/).
